## Evaluating a "A quantum method to test the satisfiability of Boolean functions"

## Usage
* Requires Python 3.10+ w/ PIP
* Install Python dependencies:
    * `python3 -m pip install -r ./requirements.txt`

You can run the notebooks in VS Code using the ipynb extension.


## Navigating this repository

* `latex/`: Some latex code used to generate formulas and figures for the presentation
* `lib/`: Common Python code
* `djsat_satisfiable.ipynb`: An implementation of the Deutsch-Josza algorithm on a satisfiable circuit.
* `djsat_unsatisfiable.ipynb`: An implementation of the Deutsch-Josza algorithm on an usatisfiable circuit.

`etof.ipynb` and `playground.ipynb` were done to further my own understanding.
